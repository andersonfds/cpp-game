- Download it from [here](https://github.com/andersonfds/cpp-game/releases/download/1.0.0/game_macOS.zip)

## How to compile from source

```bash
brew install libpng
make

### Running on other platforms

I don't know, but you can try. I think you'd just need to remove the OpenGL stuff on the `Makefile`. Since that is mac specific. Other than that it should work fine. LMK if you try it.
